Planora: A Collaborative Task Management Web App

Welcome to Planora, my personal passion project—a sleek, modern task management web application crafted to empower teams to organize, track, and conquer projects with ease. Built from the ground up as a showcase of my skills in full-stack development, Planora reflects my dedication to creating intuitive, scalable, and collaborative solutions. Designed for companies, it enables multiple employees and employers to work concurrently, streamline workflows, and stay on top of tasks with features like dynamic tagging (e.g., Urgent, Complete). This project is a testament to my ability to blend creativity with technical expertise, making it a standout addition to my portfolio.

Whether it’s assigning tasks, tracking progress, or prioritizing urgent deliverables, Planora is designed to keep teams in sync and projects on track.
